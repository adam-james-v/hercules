# Hercules

Use the game Hades to become strong in real life.

1. Start a Hades run.
2. At every boon choice, roll exercise options.
3. Perform the exercise corresponding to your boon choice in game.
4. Use the boon rarity to determine the number of reps to complete.
5. Have fun and modify exercises to your skill level!
6. There is no shame in any level of fitness. The strength is in the effort.

This is a version 1.0 release of this idea. 

You can check out the discussions in this repo to offer suggestions for improvements. You can even fork the repo and mess around with things yourself if you'd like!

Hercules is an idea I had while playing Supergiant's amazing rougelite Hades. I workout regularly, but want to add a stronger focus to mobility and overall body control and athletic strength. Playing games doesn't typically contribute to such goals, but with a bit of creativity, I figured I could give it an honest try.

Have fun and be safe! Your health is important and you can have fun being fit.

## Some Things I have to do:

- add the ability for the user to disable exercises that require certain equipment that may be unavailable
- add ability for the user to tweak rep ranges for each exercise. This may be necessary for changing difficulty of a workout.
- add more exercises.
